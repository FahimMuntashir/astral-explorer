# ASTRAL EXPLORER

## High-Level Project Summary
### We created Astral Explorer, an interactive web application for students to explore the universe. Its goal is to inspire young minds by providing a dynamic, immersive learning experience. The platform allows users to select an exoplanet and view the night sky, seeing how constellations would appear from that location. Through interactive tools, users can even create custom constellations. By making astronomy engaging and accessible, Astral Explorer fosters a deep interest in space science and exploration, which could lead to innovative ideas and future discoveries in this field.

## DETAILED PROJECT DESCRIPTION
NASA tasked us with creating a unique educational tool for students to visualize the universe from various perspectives. With Astral Explorer, users can select an exoplanet and view an interactive 3D star chart. The tool offers the ability to visualize constellations from this new viewpoint and even create custom constellations. This engaging method makes it easier for students to grasp complex astronomical concepts while sparking their curiosity about the stars and planetary systems beyond our own. Our hope is that this tool will make space exploration more relatable and exciting for a younger audience, ultimately contributing to their understanding and passion for astronomy.

## OUR SOLUTION
We developed a web application that gives users the chance to explore the universe from different points in space. By using data from NASA’s open-source databases and APIs, Astral Explorer brings an interactive 3D star chart and solar system to life. With the option to create custom constellations, students can actively participate in learning, making the experience not only informative but fun and personalized. This tool is ideal for students who want to expand their knowledge of astronomy in a dynamic and visually engaging manner. It eliminates traditional, static diagrams and provides a more immersive and interactive experience.

## HOW DOES IT WORK?
The system architecture centers on a 3D visualization tool that simulates the view of the night sky from various exoplanets. As users explore the sky from these different vantage points, they can click on stars to create custom constellations. The tool uses NASA data to accurately depict star positions and movement, allowing users to interact with real-time astronomy information. If students want to learn more about specific stars or planets, they can click on them to access detailed information. The combination of real-time data and a hands-on interface keeps students engaged and helps them better understand astronomical concepts.
